Below is my FInal SQL project, using the data from chinook I was able to answer the following questions.

--Show which customers that do not reside in the USA

SELECT Firstname,LastName,CustomerId,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country<>'USA';

--Show the customers who only reside in Germany

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country='Germany';

--Find the invoices for customers who are from Germany

SELECT cust.FirstName , cust.LastName ,
i.invoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT OUTER JOIN chinook.customers cust 
ON i.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry ='Germany';

--Show the employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title='Sales Support Agent';

--Find a distinct list of billing countries from the invoive table

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

--Provide a query showing the invoices associated with each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, E.LastName, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--Show the invoice total, customer name, country , and sales agent for all invoices and customers

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--How many invoices were there in 2009

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- What are the total sales for 2009

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.name,inv.InvoiceLineID
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON inv.TrackId = t.TrackId;

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.name, t.composer, inv.InvoiceLineID
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON inv.TrackId = t.TrackId;

--Provide a query that shows all the tracks and include the album name, media type, and genre

SELECT t.name AS'Track Name' , a.Title as 'Album Title',
m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

-- Show the total sales made by each sales agent

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e 

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices Inv
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
Group by e.FirstName';

--Which Sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
